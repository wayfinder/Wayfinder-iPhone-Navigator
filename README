This is the repository for the Navigator client developed by Wayfinder.
It is released under the BSD license.

To build the navigator client you also need to build the libraries for Cpp-Core-v2, 
since they contain the core engine for the client.

More information about the client and how to build it can be found at oss.wayfinder.com
